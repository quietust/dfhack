``gui/*`` scripts implement dialogs in the main game window.

In order to avoid user confusion, as a matter of policy all these tools
display the word "DFHack" on the screen somewhere while active.
When that is not appropriate because they merely add keybinding hints to
existing DF screens, they deliberately use red instead of green for the key.
